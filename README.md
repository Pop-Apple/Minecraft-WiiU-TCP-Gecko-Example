## TCP Gecko Example

Here is a sample tool to connect to WiiU's TCPGecko  
The API is not homegrown.  
By using this repository  
It is possible to easily create a connection tool  
The name of the repository is `Minecraft-WiiU`  
I believe that most of the WiiU player population is for Minecraft.
